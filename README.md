# OtterClock
This is the development of an alarm clock using the Pomodoro technique. The app uses an otter to encourage students. 
The app:
- Helps students to stay concentrated on their task at hand while not being overwhelmed and stressed. 
- Animates an Office Otter that can go on breaks and work, depending on how much time has passed. 
- Limit a user's screen time and stay focused on a specific task instead.
